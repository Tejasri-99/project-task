In 2012, Prabhas starred in Rebel, an action film directed by Raghava Lawrence. Sashidhar from The Times of India stated, "The film belongs to hard-core Prabhas fans as the movie is stylish and visually rich but not much in content".Purnima Ranawat from NDTV said, "Rebel serves up fare for the mass audience. The film will be definitely liked by Prabhas' fans. Watch it for the dancing talent of Tamannaah Bhatia and action skills of Prabhas."Radhika Rajamani from Rediff.com gave the movie one and half stars out of five and said, "Working with hardly any storyline, director Raghava Lawrence had made a film that is arduous to watch... Rebel is a movie for the masses and certainly not for the discerning audience."He rendered voice for a short cameo for the film Denikaina Ready (2012).

In 2013, Prabhas starred in Mirchi. Jeevi of Idlebrain.com gave a rating of 3.25 out of 5, commenting that "First half of Mirchi is decent. Flashback episode which occupies 100% of second half is good. Climax could have been better. The plus points of the film are Prabhas, music and all-round orientation. On a whole, Mirchi has all the ingredients of a commercial potboiler".Mahesh S Koneru gave his verdict that "At the Box Office, the film will turn in a good commercial performance", giving the film a score of 3.25/5.Way2movies also gave a rating of 3.25/5, giving the verdict that "Prabhas rocks the show in this decent yet formulaic commercial entertainer".[27] Super good movies gave the film 3 stars in a scale of 5, reviewing that "Go and Watch Mirchi, It entertains both Class and Mass.

<h2 id="motivation from prabhas">Motivation from Prabhas</h2>
<p>There are three major reasons to get motivated through Prabhas’s success story:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Sincerity towards life</li>
<li>Dedication towards goal</li>
He has proved all the above qualities very well and his success is a proof to it. I am impressed at his career graph. Irrespective of what role you perform in life and how much politics you face in your environment, no one can snatch your destiny and things that you deserve. If you have that keen and sharp vision to follow your goal, no one can stop you.

Prabhas is an inspiration to many. I believe that politics and manipulations happen everywhere, but we need to continue to invest our time and efforts in our goal. People notice it and they notice it pretty soon. Go for your goals and do not get distracted by the petty issues around you. The Universe wants you to connect with it.</p>
